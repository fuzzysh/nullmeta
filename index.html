                                        <p>Despite being serialized to great success for over 5 years, Null Meta has not had an anime announced. However, Null Meta remains highly popular and has a consistent record of beating competing manga in sales. While it becomes less and less likely for Null Meta to recieve an adaptation as time goes on, I believe Null Meta still has a fighting chance! Please choose to support Null Meta as best as you can so we can all see our favourite characters in our favourite scenarios come to life with professional voice acting, music, and animation!</p>
